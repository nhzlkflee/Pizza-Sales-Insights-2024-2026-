### ðŸ“Š Outcomes
The dashboard reveals that the pizza business generated steady revenue with 1,004 total orders and $18K in sales, driven mainly by Cheese and Non-Veg pizzas, with Medium size being the most preferred. While weekday orders dominate, a notable portion comes from weekends, offering room for targeted promotions. California leads in city-wise sales, and July marks the highest order volume, suggesting seasonal spikes. However, delivery delaysâ€”averaging over 17 minutesâ€”highlight a key operational issue, especially for complex orders. Overall, the insights support data-driven decisions to optimize marketing, menu offerings, and delivery efficiency.
